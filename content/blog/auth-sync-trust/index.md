## Introduction

Authentication in a modern fullstack app isn't just about logging in-it's about **establishing a durable trust contract** between all parts of your system: the frontend, the backend API, and the data layer (often managed via a service like Supabase or a custom DB). And while frameworks like NextAuth, Firebase, or Supabase Auth promise convenience, the reality is often messier.

This article explores how to design a seamless, secure, and maintainable authentication pipeline where each layer communicates **just enough** to stay in sync-without coupling too tightly or leaking user data.

## The Core Problem: Fragmented Auth Contexts

In a typical React+Node stack, you‚Äôll often run into the following:

- Your **frontend** holds a session via cookies (e.g., via NextAuth).
- Your **backend** expects a Bearer token or session ID in headers.
- Your **database** needs a user ID or tenant ID to apply row-level access control.

These systems often **don‚Äôt agree on who the user is**, unless you design the protocol and flow intentionally.

### Real-World Symptoms

- `session.user` exists in the frontend, but `req.user` is undefined on the backend.
- Auth tokens exist, but are missing or stale in client-side requests.
- Supabase rules fail silently because the user's ID isn't passed correctly.
- Your app works in dev, but breaks in prod due to cookie domain mismatches.

---

## Principle 1: One Source of Truth for Identity

Pick one place to derive identity, and propagate that downward.

- If using **NextAuth**, let the session hold the canonical `user.id`.
- When making client -> server calls, always inject that identity as a Bearer token or signed cookie.
- On the backend, validate this token and extract the user.
- Use the resulting `user.id` as a consistent key for all DB-level permissions.

```ts
// client/apiClient.ts
const session = await getSession()
config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${session?.user.id}`
```

---

## Principle 2: Auth is a Flow, Not a Snapshot

Too many apps treat auth as a static object: `session = {...}`. But sessions evolve:

- Users get logged out.
- Tokens expire.
- Accounts are deleted or permissions change.

Each layer (frontend, backend, database) should **revalidate** auth context when needed.

- Use middleware on the API to validate every incoming token.
- Keep token lifetimes short and refresh seamlessly.
- Avoid caching stale identities.

```ts
// backend/middleware/auth.ts
const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(" ")[1]
const user = await getUserFromToken(token)
if (!user) return res.status(401).send("Unauthorized")
req.user = user
```

---

## Principle 3: Use Context-Passing, Not Global State

Avoid relying on implicit global state like `sessionStorage`, `cookies`, or `req.session`-unless you control the whole pipeline. Instead, **pass identity explicitly** in requests.

This avoids issues like:

- Inconsistent behavior between SSR and client-side calls
- Undebuggable bugs in CI/CD environments
- Session mismatch across subdomains

```ts
fetch("/api/data", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${session.user.id}` },
})
```

---

## Advanced Techniques and Deep Dives

### üîê Secure Token Storage

One of the most critical aspects of auth implementation is the secure storage of tokens.

- **Access tokens** should never be stored in `localStorage` due to XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Refresh tokens** should be stored in `HttpOnly` cookies, making them inaccessible to JavaScript and more resilient to XSS attacks.

#### Recommended pattern (SSR + CSR hybrid apps)

1. Store the `refreshToken` in a secure `HttpOnly` cookie after login.
2. Create a protected `/api/token` endpoint that reads the cookie and returns a fresh `accessToken`.
3. On the frontend, call this endpoint to get an `accessToken` and store it only in memory.

```ts
// server-side: set secure cookie
res.setHeader(
  "Set-Cookie",
  serialize("refreshToken", token, {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
    sameSite: "lax",
    path: "/",
  })
)

// client-side: fetch access token
const res = await fetch("/api/token")
const { accessToken } = await res.json()
```

This ensures that no token ever sits in storage where an attacker could grab it.

---

### üîÅ Refresh Token Flow

Access tokens should be short-lived. When they expire, your client must:

1. Detect the `401 Unauthorized` error.
2. Trigger a refresh flow using the secure cookie.
3. Retry the original request transparently.

#### Example interceptor logic

```ts
apiClient.interceptors.response.use(undefined, async error => {
  if (error.response?.status === 401) {
    await fetch("/api/token/refresh") // Refresh happens via secure cookie
    return apiClient.request(error.config) // Retry the original request
  }
  return Promise.reject(error)
})
```

On the backend:

```ts
// POST /api/token/refresh
const refreshToken = req.cookies.refreshToken
const user = await validateRefreshToken(refreshToken)
if (!user) return res.status(401).send("Invalid refresh token")
const newToken = createAccessToken(user)
res.json({ accessToken: newToken })
```

This creates a **resilient auth pipeline** that gracefully recovers without user interruption.

---

### üß≠ Multi-Provider Identity Normalization

When users can log in with different providers (GitHub, Google, credentials), it's easy for your system to lose track of who they are.

#### Strategy

- Create a `users` table that maps external provider IDs to a unified internal `userId`.
- Always store and propagate this `unifiedUserId`.

```ts
// Backend
function resolveUnifiedUser(providerId: string, provider: string): string {
  const user = db.users.findOne({ provider, providerId })
  return user?.internalId
}

// Attach this to token payloads
const token = sign({ userId: unifiedId }, SECRET)
```

By resolving all external identities to one consistent ID, you avoid edge cases where the same person gets treated as multiple users.

---

### üí• Bug Case: Cookie Auth but API 401

**Symptom:** User logs in successfully, but every API request returns `401 Unauthorized`.

**Cause:** The cookie storing the token is scoped to `/api`, but frontend fetches are made from `/`.

#### Diagnosis

- Use DevTools > Application > Cookies to inspect path restrictions.
- Look for missing `Authorization` header or absent cookie.

#### Solution

```ts
// Correct path on server
serialize("token", value, { path: "/" })
```

Always scope cookies to `/` unless you are certain you want to restrict them.

---

### üßµ Session vs Database Identity Drift

**Problem:** Session token exists, but the user was deleted from the database.

This often causes silent failures-frontend appears logged in, but the backend refuses operations.

#### Solution

Always verify backend token **and** check user existence in DB:

```ts
const userId = await getCurrentUserId(req);
if (!userId) {
  logger.error("User not found");
  res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  return;
}

if !(await db.users.exists(user.id)) {
  return res.status(403).send("Invalid session or deleted user");
}

export async function getCurrentUserId(req: Request): Promise<string | null> {
  const token = await getToken({ req, secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET });
  return (token?.id as string) ?? null;
}
```

This guards against stale or orphaned sessions.

---

### üß™ Debugging and Traceability Enhancements

To effectively debug and audit auth flows:

- Add a trace ID to every request.
- Return contextual headers during development.
- Log token contents and associated user at the edge.

#### Example

```ts
// Middleware
const traceId = uuid()
req.traceId = traceId
logger.info({ traceId, userId: req.user?.id })

// Response headers (dev only)
res.setHeader("X-Trace-Id", traceId)
res.setHeader("X-User-Id", req.user?.id)
```

Use logs and these headers to correlate frontend/backend issues precisely.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Role-Based and Attribute-Based Access Control

A flat `user.id` isn't always enough. You need roles (e.g. `admin`, `editor`) or scopes (`repo:read`, `repo:write`).

#### Encode roles in your token

```ts
const token = sign({ userId, role: "admin" }, SECRET)
```

Then check them in protected routes:

```ts
if (decoded.role !== "admin") return res.status(403).send("Forbidden")
```

In Supabase (with RLS):

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Admins can see all"
  ON "logs"
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'admin');
```

Combine token claims and RLS policies for full-stack enforcement.

## üß† When to Build vs Delegate Auth

As a Senior or Staff-level engineer, choosing **not to fully delegate authentication** to platforms like Supabase Auth or Clerk isn‚Äôt about reinventing the wheel - it‚Äôs about **owning the trust contract** between your application layers: frontend, backend, and database.  
However, fully delegating authentication essentially depends on your project, team, timeframe and budget. Like a lot of decisions, it‚Äôs a balancing act.

### When to Build

- **When you need a custom auth system** that meets your exact needs.
- **When you need a custom auth system** that integrates with your existing infrastructure.
  - e.g. integrating with an existing database, or integrating with a third-party API.

### When to Delegate

- **When you don't need** to have specfic auth flows or features.
- **When you don't need** to integrate with existing infrastructure.
- **When you need** to have a quick, simple auth system rapidly built.

### Key strategic reasons

- Full control over **session propagation** across SSR, API routes, and RLS database layers.
- Support for **hybrid authentication flows** (OAuth, credentials, internal accounts).
- **Avoiding vendor lock-in** for long-term maintainability and architectural freedom.

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

- Frontend, backend, and database **must agree on who the user is**.
- Treat authentication as a **living flow**, not a frozen object.
- **Avoid implicit global state**; pass identity explicitly.
- Use **short-lived access tokens + secure HttpOnly cookies**.
- Normalize external accounts with a **unified user ID** strategy.
- Include **roles and scopes** in your tokens and enforce them across the stack.

---

## Conclusion

Syncing authentication across the frontend, backend, and database isn‚Äôt trivial - but it becomes manageable when grounded in clear architectural principles:

1. **Establish a single source of identity.**
2. **Design authentication as a renewable, revalidating flow.**
3. **Pass identity context intentionally across system boundaries.**

Get these right, and your system becomes more secure, observable, and adaptable - without sacrificing developer velocity or user experience.
