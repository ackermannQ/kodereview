At some point, you will have to work in a group. If you are in the web development it could be the front-end or the back-end team. If you are a software developer, it could be a team specific to your software. Anyway, you will have different tickets to process, you will have to plan the time each one will take. And you will systematically be wrong.

It's likely that you are working in iterations (or sprints). The tech lead will address tickets usually per skills or left time to the team members. Now, it's time to estimate how long each ticket will take to complete.

## How does it work ?
How do you plan your iteration ?  
Short answer, you can't.  

The longer one is you will have to break down to small tasks each steps required to complete a product backlog item.  
Besides, someone from the QA or Product owning would probably add several bugs and features along the way. So, how would you be able to plan your work?  

Usually, the manager will set a meeting at the begining of an iteration where the differents tickets (backlogs or bugs) would be dispatched among the team members. Now, with the tickets in hand, the first thing to do is try to split in small tasks the features or bugs.  

In order to plan correctly - or at least the best - the iteration, you need to take some time to organize the work. It would take several hours, even half a day, but it's really important for the rest of the team to know exactly how much time you have left!   

Try to define the tasks to accomplish in order to realize the work. Then, the trickiest part, try to imagine how long it will take to complete. At first, you will be wrong, you will tend to attribute less hours than it really requires to the tasks - vecause everything is usually more complicated than what you have anticipated.  
No worries, as you gain experience and good knowledge of the code base you will have a better idea of the time required to finish your work. 

An other pitfall is neglecting the incoming bugs. Some iterations you would have less returns from the QA or the clients, and often at the contrary you will wonder how the application is working at all. But remember, on average bugs will pop up during the sprint so remember to let some time unassigned for these occasions, or upcoming meetings.


> So am I doomed ?  

Well, yes, you probably won't have any chance to plan perfectly your work, you will plan to much or to little time.  
Accept it and move on, try to do your best!  
A good habit is to add by default 25% more time to what was initially anticipated. It seems a lot but experience shows that it's very common that your feature evolves along the way and you end up refactoring your code or just changing everything already done.  

## To conclude - The key takeaways
You may not be able to plan perfectly your iteration, however it doesn't mean that you should spend little time trying to. This is essential and a point that really sort out new developers to experienced ones.  
Why?  
Because it makes you look professional. Even if it's not perfect, when planning your work, you think about it and if someone has a related question, you already have the begining of an answer.  
Besides it's a very important skill that is not necessarily taught at the University or Engineering school, so just by doing this you would stand up from the mass of other developers.

- Spend really extensive time to plan your iteration
- All the work you are doing now you won't have to do later, planing and analyzing is essential for further work
- Add 25% to every initial planned time
- It would make you looks professional
