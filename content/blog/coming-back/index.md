The last post I wrote was in 2022. A lot has changed since then.

Since that time, I became a full-stack developer. I spent months immersed in real-world challenges - writing backend services, building interfaces in Vue.js and React, and delivering features under tight deadlines.

I worked in the game industry, where I learned to ship polished, player-facing systems, while juggling the unpredictable nature of production pipelines. And no kidding, when you have to ensure the portability of games between Android and iOS platforms, you know you're gonna have a **hard** time with the build pipelines. That experience taught me how to balance creativity with structure - how to make ideas real, fast, and flexible.

The most valuable lesson I learned in that time was the importance of resilience - and that even hudge company can have the worst SDKs with an even worse developer experience, but that's a topic for another day. I realized that the most important thing in life is to keep pushing forward, even when things get tough. That's how I became the go-to person for any kind of technical problem, and how I've been able to build a career that's both challenging and rewarding.

As my responsibilities grew, I stepped into the role of front-end product owner, bridging the gap between technical teams and product direction. That transition pushed me to become a better communicator and a more strategic thinker, while staying grounded in the realities of shipping code.

In parallel, I started building tools for developers - automation scripts, custom integrations, [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hookguard) and more recently a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ackermannQ.botpress-tools) designed to streamline the development of chatbot integrations. This projects, in particular, was a turning point: it forced me to think beyond features, and focus on developer experience, speed, and clarity.

Now, Iâ€™m about to join a company at the cutting edge of AI and conversational interfaces. It's a space where all of my past experiences - from game logic to productivity tooling - converge. This next chapter is about building smarter tools, more human interactions, and ultimately better systems for thinking and creating.

This post is both a recap and a turning point. Iâ€™ve grown a lot in the shadows these past couple of years. Now itâ€™s time to share more of the journey.
